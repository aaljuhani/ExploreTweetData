What's odd is the timing. Was McMaster upset about Syria statement, or Bannon's involvement in "unmasking" scandal?
In light of Sessions DOJ refusing to enforce police oversight, I wonder if people who attacked HRC for her stance on BLM feel...stupid?
Bannon should have NEVER been on the NSC. He was only there because the Golden Goose doesn't/can't read.

If "Barry Manilow is Gay"  is #BreakingNews, today must be the slowest news day in history.  


Bannon being preemptively removed from the NSC makes me think we're about to have a story about him drop in the WaPo, WSJ or NYT shortly.
